### About Me

I'm a **graduate Electrical Engineer** with a strong background in **Hardware (HW) design and verification** and **Embedded Systems** development. My passion lies in combining theoretical knowledge with practical application to create innovative solutions in these fields.

### Technologies & Tools I Work With:

**Hardware (HW):**
* **Hardware Description Languages:** Verilog, SystemVerilog, VHDL
* **Platforms/Architectures:** FPGAs, Microcontrollers

**Software (SW):**
* **Programming Languages:** Python, C, MATLAB
* **Platforms & Environments:** Arduino, STM32, ESP32, Raspberry Pi, Linux

### Featured Projects

Here are a few projects I'm proud of that showcase my diverse capabilities:

* **UART Design and Verification:**
    * Designed a fully functional UART transmitter & receiver in **Verilog**.
    * Built a modular **SystemVerilog** testbench using **UVM** principles (Driver, Monitor, Scoreboard) for comprehensive verification.
* **Real-Time Optical Sighting System:**
    * Developed a real-time human detection system using **YOLOv8** and **OpenCV**.
* **Embedded Temperature & Humidity Monitoring System:**
    * Created a simple embedded system using **Arduino Uno** to monitor temperature and humidity with a DHT12 sensor.
    * The system displays real-time data on an I2C LCD and triggers alerts (buzzer and LED) when thresholds are exceeded.
